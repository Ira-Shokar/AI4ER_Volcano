# AI4ER_Volcano
 Jupyter Notebooks for AI4ER Practical on ML for image processing
 This was initially set up with the aim as operating as a Binder, but this did not operate effectively, eventually due to limitations with the GUI options and the memory allocation in the way I was trying to use Binder.
 Please find the environment that I used to run locally on my mac in envtest.yml and also the urls of the shareable links to the data files (in Dropbox) in the postBuild file.
